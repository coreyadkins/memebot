# MemeBot v0.2

## What does this do?

### The meme era
Everyone alive in 2016 was born too late to explore the earth, yet too early to explore beyond.
Until then, it is just the right time to browse dank memes.

### The meme browser
Meet Jules.
As a Millennial holding down a part time job whilst attending school,
Jules has very little time for browsing memes.

### The meme master
Enter MemeBot.
MemeBot automatically browses the top memes for Jules,
and captures the zeitgeist of the memisphere.
Using Markov processing, MemeBot takes this data and generates fresh material.
Now Jules isn't just browsing dank memes: Jules is creating OC!

### Finding the golden meme
Is our MemeBots learning? You bet it are!
Jules is able to review these *rare* memes and teach it which ones
are **dank** and which are just plain **stank**.

## What do I need to set it up?

To initialize MemeBot, run initialize.py -- follow the prompts,
you'll need to set it up in this order:

1. Database
1. Corpus (try a few hundred entries)
1. Output

## How do I run it?

Run main.py -- choose which meme *you* think is the dankest,
or press the red button to quit.
You'll need to vote quite a few times to get useful data.


## What's left to be done?

* reports
* improved meme selection
